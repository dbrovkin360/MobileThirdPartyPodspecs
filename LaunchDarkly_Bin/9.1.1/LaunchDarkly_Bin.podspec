                   LaunchDarkly is the feature management platform that software teams use to build better software, faster. Development teams use feature management as a best practice to separate code deployments from feature releases. With LaunchDarkly teams control their entire feature lifecycles from concept to launch to value.
                   With LaunchDarkly, you can:
                   * Release a new feature to a subset of your users, like a group of users who opt-in to a beta tester group.
                   * Slowly roll out a feature to an increasing percentage of users and track the effect that feature has on key metrics.
                   * Instantly turn off a feature that is causing problems, without re-deploying code or restarting the application with a changed config file.
                   * Maintain granular control over your usersâ€™ experience by granting access to certain features based on any attribute you choose. For example, provide different users with different functionality based on their payment plan.
                   * Disable parts of your application to facilitate maintenance, without taking everything offline.
